Lang is a test programming language with an interpreter and a compiler. The beauty of this language is that it can be natively interpreted or compiled.
You can use the interpreter functionality to run interactive programs if you desire, or to test your program in a virtual machine before running it as
native code.

This project is another one of my toy projects, its main goal is to help me learn a little more about compilers and how they work, as well as abstract
programming languages. Feel free to add new features to this, write a standard library, whatever you want. All of the language keywords (and relative
descriptions of what they do) are in AST.txt
